## Introduction 

"Calm Waters Foundation" is my first assessed portfolio project, developed as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. This project showcases my skills in HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap to create a responsive, accessible website dedicated to mental health awareness. The site is designed to provide users with essential mental health information, stress management tips, and resources for support. Through a clean, calming layout and structured content, Calm Waters Foundation aims to create an inclusive, supportive environment for all visitors while fulfilling the requirements of the provided brief focused on accessible, user-centered design

## Project Outline

### External User’s Goal: 
The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.

### Site Owner’s Goal: 
The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.


### Key Objectives

- Design and implement an interactive front-end web application using HTML and CSS based on user experience design principles, accessibility, and responsiveness.
- Test and validate the web application through the development, implementation, and deployment stages.
- Deploy the one-page web application to a cloud platform.
- Maximise future maintainability through documentation, code structure, and organisation.
- Leverage AI tools to orchestrate the software development process.


## Project Planning

### UX Design

### User Stories 

- I am the site owner who wants to create a supportive environment. I want the page to have a welcoming hero section with positive messaging so that users feel encouraged to learn more about mental health and seek help if needed.

- I am a user interested in learning about common mental health issues. I want clear, concise information presented in a structured way so that I can understand the basics without needing to dig through too much text.

- As a user concerned about privacy, I want reassurance that my information is protected so that I feel safe interacting with the website, especially if I log or track anything personal.

- I am someone looking for ways to manage stress. I want quick tips and helpful advice organized in an easy-to-read format so that I can apply them to my life right away.

- I am a site owner aiming for a responsive design. I want the page to adjust seamlessly on any screen size so that users on different devices can access the content without issues.

- I am a visitor seeking basic mental health information. I want a simple, calming layout so that I can easily find the information without feeling overwhelmed.

- I am a user interested in uplifting messages. I want to read positive affirmations so that I can feel encouraged and motivated while browsing the site.

- I am a person who may need additional resources for mental health support. I want a list of reputable links to mental health organizations so that I can access further information and support if needed.

- As a teacher seeking to support my students, I want educational materials or activities that I can use in my classroom so that I can promote mental wellness among students.

- As a user interested in mental health events, I want a calendar or list of upcoming webinars and workshops so that I can participate in live learning opportunities.
